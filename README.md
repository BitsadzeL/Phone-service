At first, you have to import database file in phpmyadmin and name database "project". This file is in Database folder. If you want to use project as an admin, which has all of the privileggies, you should login with username/password: admin/admin.
Index page is "login.php" file, so you should open this page at first to use project.
I was using xampp for this project. This project was in folder c:/xampp/htdocs/project
